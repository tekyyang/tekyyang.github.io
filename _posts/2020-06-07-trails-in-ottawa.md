Due to COVID, I found myself spend a lot of time in trails these days to keep social distancing as far as possible. Previously I didn't know there are so many cute trails in Ottawa until I visited them.

## Hunt Club

### Pine Grove Trail

[Davidson Rd, Ottawa, ON K1A 0K4](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Pine+Grove+Trail/@45.3543747,-75.5921169,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipPdeJDIL_bSU9f44Q2WYBynwblq9fZTiBPTWIJf!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipPdeJDIL_bSU9f44Q2WYBynwblq9fZTiBPTWIJf%3Dw114-h86-k-no!7i4032!8i3024!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x4cce094089514f1d:0x705519bd4bfd5bd0!2sPine+Grove+Trail,+Ottawa,+ON+K1G+3N4!3b1!8m2!3d45.3544373!4d-75.6044984!3m4!1s0x0:0xff0beedd9938f08f!8m2!3d45.3543807!4d-75.5919993)

Pretty lovely trails not so far away from Hunt Club neighborhood. I like how the trails are tidy and seems usually get cleaned up by the City. Popular place for family to do cycling, hiking or just have some fun time with their dogs. The parking lot seems not working right now but it’s fine to just park your car next to Davidson road.

### Athans Park & Conroy Pit

[1779 St Barbara St, Ottawa, ON K1T 1M3](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Athans+Park/@45.3555436,-75.6249878,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipO3mRGuF6-W2DxSsxlaw-OsO1i-Np0RviS7tvQV!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipO3mRGuF6-W2DxSsxlaw-OsO1i-Np0RviS7tvQV%3Dw152-h86-k-no!7i5312!8i2988!4m5!3m4!1s0x4cce091f87e5ce95:0xf9661aa450cee1fa!8m2!3d45.3556604!4d-75.6248392)

We found this place when waiting for car maintenances in Hunt Club Honda, so you can see how close it to the neighborhood is. After taking a walk I start to envy the residents here to have such a close park to hang out – a forest right behind someone’s yard! Athans Park and Conroy Pit are actually not far away from each other, which I just consider the two sides of the whole hiking area.

## Merivale

### Pinhey Forest

[Ottawa, ON K2G 0B8](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Pinhey+Forest/@45.3283828,-75.7390489,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipM9rvb8CQdjUm-hMkzP3tQ8O6H0mfOjoXt4B0tv!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipM9rvb8CQdjUm-hMkzP3tQ8O6H0mfOjoXt4B0tv%3Dw114-h86-k-no!7i4032!8i3024!4m5!3m4!1s0x4cce07f35650cfd5:0x863aea356ffd2938!8m2!3d45.3283828!4d-75.7390488)

This is definitely a gem hidden in Merivale: a little forest in Nepean close to a lot of places you are familiar with. The best part is you can basically park at Nepean Sportsplex’s parking lot and enjoy the trails. We also found an ester egg there: if you walk a little bit further, you can find Pinhey Sand Dune in the middle of our little forest! (Just like how the trees appear in the middle of the city) Also, walking along the Merivale Gardens neighbourhood is also quite relaxing so I need to say although the trails are not super long but they are full of surprises! 

## Rockcliffe

### Ottawa River Pathway

[1505 Sir George-Étienne Cartier Pkwy, Ottawa, ON K1K 4Y5](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Rockcliffe+Yacht+Club/@45.4635965,-75.6427816,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipMgh3SHCBwL6AuDSHTDqeVR9pnGVxxiB72FfNQv!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipMgh3SHCBwL6AuDSHTDqeVR9pnGVxxiB72FfNQv%3Dw114-h86-k-no!7i4160!8i3120!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x4cce04d5775115ed:0x7db65b9c9ceb784c!2s1170+Sir+George-%C3%89tienne+Cartier+Pkwy,+Ottawa,+ON!3b1!8m2!3d45.4565256!4d-75.6793374!3m4!1s0x4cce04d57751603d:0xe6fa1a5fde8939b5!8m2!3d45.4635959!4d-75.6427816)

This is a long pathway close to Ottawa River. Unlike other others that usually surrounded by trees, you can keep walking along the river and enjoy the changing water scene, the clouds, and Gatineau on the other side. The address above is just a reference while you can actually park anywhere close to the parkway (FYI: the parking in Aviation museum is not free during weekend though).


More to come....
